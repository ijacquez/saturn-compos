Sega's code (vblank.c/h) falls under its original license (example use only,
might not pass Sega QA, shouldn't be assumed to be bug free). Ponut64's sound
engine (pcmsys.c/h, sdrv.bin) falls under its original license (MIT). The repo
with his source code can be found at https://github.com/ponut64/68k/. My code
(everything else in the repo), graphics, music, sound effects, and other assets
may not be used for commercial purposes or bundled with anything that costs
money (example: selling a CD with the game on it, even if you sell it at what
the CD costs to buy) without my permission. You may redistribute any or all of
my files in this repo (https://github.com/shicky256/saturndevsbl), as long as
you include this text file with your redistributed file(s).

No warranty, no implied warranty, don't sue me if your Saturn dies etc.
